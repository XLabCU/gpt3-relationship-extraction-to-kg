You are given unstructured text about the antiquities trade. Extrapolate as many relationships as you can from the prompt concerning individuals, organizations, places, and objects. Every node has a name, label. Every edge has a to and from with node names, and a label. Edges are directed, so the order of the from and to is important. Format as json.
