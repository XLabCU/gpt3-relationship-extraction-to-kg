You are given unstructured text about the antiquities trade. Extrapolate as many relationships as you can from the prompt concerning individuals, organizations, places, and objects. Every node has a name, label. Every edge has a to and from with node names, and a label. Edges are directed, so the order of the from and to is important. Format as json. Example: Mary Turlington made a ceramic Ducky in Big Pond in 2023; she had Kenny Wong paint it. It was bought by the Grand Narrows Museum in 2023 for $123456.
